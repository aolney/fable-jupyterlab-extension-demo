The following commands were used:

 ts2fable node_modules/@jupyterlab/application/lib/index.d.ts imports/JupyterlabApplication.fs -e @jupyterlab/application
 ts2fable node_modules/@jupyterlab/apputils/lib/index.d.ts imports/JupyterlabApputils.fs -e @jupyterlab/apputils
 ts2fable node_modules/@phosphor/coreutils/lib/index.d.ts imports/PhosphorCoreutils.fs -e @phosphor/coreutils
 ts2fable node_modules/@phosphor/messaging/lib/index.d.ts imports/PhosphorMessaging.fs -e @phosphor/messaging
 ts2fable node_modules/@phosphor/widgets/lib/index.d.ts imports/PhosphorWidgets.fs -e @phosphor/widgets

ts2fable did a pretty good job, but the manual correction of these files seemed nontrivial.

So the current strategy is to do adhoc imports and maybe return to creating a full foreign interface later.
